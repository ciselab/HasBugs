# Rhodos Tools 

To be done 

- [X] Run all .sh in references and put their results in data
- [X] Dependencies to do the above (none, Shell is great)
- [X] Docker compose to run the same on windows / any machine ("Normal" Docker + shell)
- [] Script to merge the datapoint.json to dataset.jsonl
- [] Maybe: Script to produce the patches from two commits
- [] Maybe: Script to check that all projects (still) exist (e.g. curl the URL of the projects for response)
- [X] Maybe: Fill template sh from a datapoint, should work for everything except patches
