# Rhodos Tools 

To be done 

- [] Run all .sh in references and put their results in data
- [] Dependencies to do so 
- [] Docker compose to run the same on windows / any machine 
- [] Script to merge the datapoint.js to dataset.js
- [] Maybe: Script to produce the patches from two commits
- [] Maybe: Script to check that all projects (still) exist (e.g. curl the URL of the projects for response)
