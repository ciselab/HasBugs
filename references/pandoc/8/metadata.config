description="Pandoc is able to convert footnotes from the markdown-based 'Big-Note' to LaTeX. However, it produced a crash for multi-line footnotes when they were in other modulation (e.g., italics). The fix consists of re-ordering the elements and their styles so that their conversion does not clash."
